# URCade LED Controller
URCade's *emulator based* arcade button *led controller* with Arduino.

Check [URCade](https://urcade-files.ddns.net) project if you want to use our own pre-configured daemon.

## How it works
- You need a daemon installed on you emulator machine that will detect the emulator being launched and send the corresponding number of active buttons for that emulator to the arduino, as exemplified in [urcade-leds-daemon.sh](urcade-leds-daemon.sh). The arduino will receive the number of buttons related to the launched emulator and light up only the active buttons;
- The mode button will cycle between differente light effects (all on, random effects, all off);
- The hitbox toggle will let you light a hitbox on the fly.

## Possible configurations
You can use any of the 6 configurations:
- only hit buttons (a,b,x,y,l,r);
- only hit buttons with mode button;
- hit buttons + directionals (hitbox) with mode button;
- hit buttons + directionals (hitbox) with mode button and hitbox toggle;
- hit buttons + directionals (hitbox) with mode button and light sensor (for cabinets with lids);
- hit buttons + directionals (hitbox) with mode button, hitbox toggle and light sensor (for cabinets with lids).
